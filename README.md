# Space-Invaders-Construct2
<h2>A space invaders remake using Construct 2</h3>

(With an attempt to make the logic as close as possible to the original - including desctructible shields - albeit new gfx assets, etc.)
This game aims to get to the same game dynamics as the originl 1978 arcade with how shots are handled, shields, pace, etc.
To understand the intricacies this project is inspired by this C port of Space Invaders:

And of course on this reversed and explained version of the arcade:

This repo contains the latest development version of the Construct project (capx). So, just download and open with C2.
